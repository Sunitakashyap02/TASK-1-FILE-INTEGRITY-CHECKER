  * DESCRIPTION

The File Integrity Checker is a Python tool that verifies if a file has been altered by comparing its current SHA-256 hash with a previously saved one. It uses the hashlib module to generate secure hashes and stores them in a text file (hashes.txt).

When a file is checked, the tool recalculates its hash:

If the hash matches the stored one, the file is intact.

If it differs, the file has been modified or tampered with.


This tool is useful in cybersecurity, system administration, and software development to ensure file authenticity and detect unauthorized changes. It is lightweight, simple to use, and ideal for monitoring sensitive and important files.
